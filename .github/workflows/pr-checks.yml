# This defines a "Github Workflow"
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/creating-starter-workflows-for-your-organization
# 
# This workflow will help by adding some checks when a pull request is created for things like 
# making sure that a syntax error doesn't get introduced that prevents the code in 
# the main branch from building.
